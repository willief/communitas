# Communitas Project Overview

## Mission Statement

Communitas is a cross-platform desktop application designed to empower communities through secure, privacy-focused communication and collaboration tools. Built with modern web technologies and native performance, it provides a foundation for decentralized community management.

## Project Vision

To create a desktop application that enables communities to organize, communicate, and collaborate effectively while maintaining full control over their data and privacy. The application bridges the gap between web-based collaboration tools and native desktop performance.

## Core Principles

### Security First
- Memory-safe Rust backend
- Secure-by-default Tauri framework
- Content Security Policy enforcement
- API allowlisting and validation

### Privacy Focused
- Local-first data storage
- End-to-end encryption (planned)
- User data ownership
- Minimal external dependencies

### Cross-Platform Native
- Single codebase for all platforms
- Native OS integration
- Platform-specific optimizations
- Consistent user experience

### Developer Experience
- Modern development stack
- Type-safe communication
- Hot reload development
- Comprehensive testing

## Technical Foundation

### Architecture
**Desktop Application**: Tauri framework combining React frontend with Rust backend
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Backend**: Rust with async/await patterns
- **Communication**: Secure IPC via Tauri commands
- **Build**: Multi-platform native executables

### Key Technologies
- **Tauri**: Security-focused desktop framework
- **React**: Modern UI library with hooks
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **Rust**: Memory-safe system integration
- **Vite**: Fast development and build tooling

### Platform Support
- Windows (x64, ARM64)
- macOS (Intel, Apple Silicon)
- Linux (x64, ARM64)
