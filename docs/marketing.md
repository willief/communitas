Communitas: Empowering Private, Decentralised Collaboration

A New Way to Connect

Communitas rethinks online collaboration from the ground up.  It combines messaging, voice and video calling, screen sharing and collaborative file storage into a single desktop application.  Instead of relying on corporate servers, every connection is peer‑to‑peer and every identity is human‑readable.  With Communitas you chat, call and work together without surrendering your data to a third party.  It’s the privacy‑first alternative to WhatsApp, Slack and Dropbox.

Human‑Friendly Addresses

At the heart of Communitas is a four‑word identity system.  Each user, organisation or project is identified by a unique combination of four words—such as ocean‑forest‑mountain‑river—that map to a secure record in a distributed hash table ￼.  This record includes the public key, storage pointers and optional metadata ￼.  No more cryptic hashes or email‑style usernames: sharing your address is as easy as sharing a memorable phrase.  The four words are signed with a post‑quantum key so that no one can claim your name ￼.

Your Data, Your Control

Communitas stores your files in a two‑stage backup.  First, data is split into shards and distributed among your friends or colleagues; each member keeps an encrypted piece on their own device.  Second, the same shards are published to the Saorsa network’s decentralised storage using a trust‑weighted DHT and erasure coding ￼.  This means your group can recover files even if some devices are offline, and there is no single point of failure.  Everything is encrypted end‑to‑end, and only you and your chosen collaborators can decrypt it.

A Markdown‑Powered Web

Communitas includes a built‑in web: every storage container has a web directory with Markdown files.  Write your project plan in home.md, add images or videos, and publish it under your four‑word address.  Others can link to your pages using the same simple four‑word format ￼.  Because these pages live in the network, they are always available and can be edited collaboratively.  It’s a return to a text‑first internet, free from ads and trackers.

Secure Communication Without Compromise

Chats, calls and conferences use Messaging Layer Security with post‑quantum keys, ensuring that only the participants can read or listen.  Voice and video flows run over modern QUIC streams for low latency and high quality.  Screen sharing and file transfers are built‑in, so your team can brainstorm, share designs or review documents without leaving the app.  There’s no central server to snoop or censor.

Private AI Assistance

Communitas is ready for the age of AI—but on your terms.  Future versions will ship with a local language model that runs entirely on your machine.  It can summarise discussions, draft responses or help organise your files, yet none of your data is sent to the cloud.  Corporate AI services often require uploading your conversation history; Communitas keeps your interactions private.

Built for Humanity

We believe technology should serve people, not exploit them.  Communitas returns control of identity and data to individuals and communities.  It’s designed to resist censorship and corporate capture, to last through the era of quantum computers and to grow with its users.  Whether you’re organising a local club, running a global project or just chatting with friends, Communitas offers a safe and empowering space.
